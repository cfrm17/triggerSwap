# triggerSwap
An American trigger swap is a swap that is triggered by the level of an index at any time up to the expiration date. In order to model the problem, we assume that forward swap rate and index follow a joint lognormal distribution. Base on this assumption, a closed form solution can be derived for European trigger swaps.
